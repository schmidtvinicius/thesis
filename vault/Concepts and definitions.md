## DeWitt clause
Named after David DeWitt, this is a clause included in many end-user license agreements, which strictly forbids users of publishing benchmark results of that given software product without first obtaining (written) authorization from the authors/owners. 

Some companies also enforce a "DeWitt Embrace clause", which allows publishing of benchmark results, but it requires reciprocity from the company whose software is being benchmarked.

## OLTP
Stands for On-line Transaction Processing. It consists of rapid processing of large amounts of small data.
