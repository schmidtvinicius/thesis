## Research questions/objectives

- Discuss features and metrics of current stream processing system benchmarks as well as lakehouse benchmarks
	- Propose possible improvements?
- Discuss common datasets and workloads that can be used to evaluate SPSs and lakehouses 
- Propose a benchmark that evaluates SPSs in combination with lakehouses
- Use the proposed benchmark to evaluate a few state-of-the-art SPSs and lakehouses
