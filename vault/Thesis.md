## Research questions/objectives

- Discuss features and metrics of current stream processing system benchmarks as well as lakehouse benchmarks
	- Propose possible improvements?
- Discuss common datasets and workloads that can be used to evaluate SPSs and lakehouses
- Propose a benchmark that evaluates SPSs in combination with lakehouses
	- Allow for extensibility to other SPSs and lakehouses
	- Allow different datasets
- Demonstrate the proposed benchmark to evaluate a few state-of-the-art SPSs and lakehouses
	- SPSs:
		- Flink
		- Storm
		- Kafka streams?
		- Spark streaming?
	- Lakehouse:
		- Iceberg
		- Delta
		- Ducklake
