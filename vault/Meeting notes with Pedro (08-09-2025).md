trino -> streaming

create benchmark for streaming with data lake = combining data lake benchmarks with streaming benchmarks

Conferences:
VLDB
SIGMOD
CIDR
ICDE
EDBT +/-
hackernews

#Main
* Take a look at how Trino handles frequent updates/streaming (They probably struggle with that)
* End goal of the thesis will be to create a benchmark for streaming with lakehouses, so we'd combine benchmark techniques for streaming and lakehouses into a single benchmark
#Tips 
* Conferences/sources to look for paper (in order of relevance):
	* VLDB
	* SIGMOD
	* CIDR
	* ICDE
	* EDBT +/-
	* hackernews (**it's okay to cite from blog posts and such, but preference goes to conference papers**)
* Set goals for myself for every week/two weeks:
	* It's okay if I don't finish it before the stipulated deadlines, but it helps to stay motivated
