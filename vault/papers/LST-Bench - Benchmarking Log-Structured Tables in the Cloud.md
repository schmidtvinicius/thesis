## Paper summary

## Remarks
* I'll probably need to run experiments in some sort of cluster or remote server, given that many benchmarks use large amounts of data. E.g. TPC-DS can go up to 100TB of data.
* Can I reuse the proposed package and benchmark and extend it with streaming patterns, or do I have to create something entirely from scratch?
* The authors mention in Section 3.1.2 that they created their workloads using parameter values obtained empirically from customer workloads. Can I take those parameters as given, since I cannot empirically measure them?
