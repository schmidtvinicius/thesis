## Key points
* End goal of the thesis will be to create a benchmark for streaming with lakehouses, so we'd combine benchmark techniques for streaming and lakehouses into a single benchmark, e.g.:
	* https://github.com/duckdb/ducklake/tree/main/benchmark/tpch
* Start by reading papers on benchmarking of both streaming and lakehouse systems and make 3-5 paragraph summaries
* Try to get benchmarks (e.g. TPC-H) to run locally with the different systems
## Technologies to compare:
* Apache Iceberg
* Delta Lake
* Ducklake
## Tips
 * Take a look at how Trino handles frequent updates/streaming (They probably struggle with that)
* Conferences/sources to look for paper (in order of relevance):
	* VLDB
	* SIGMOD
	* CIDR
	* ICDE
	* EDBT +/-
	* hackernews (**it's okay to cite from blog posts and such, but preference goes to conference papers**)
* Set goals for myself for every week/two weeks:
	* It's okay if I don't finish it before the stipulated deadlines, but it helps to stay motivated
